## The `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression is equal to value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression is equal to value2
        break;
    default:
    // code to be executed if expression is different from all values
}
```

Here is an example of a `switch` statement:

```javascript
let day = 'Monday';

switch (day) {
    case 'Monday':
        console.log('Today is Monday');
        break;
    case 'Tuesday':
        console.log('Today is Tuesday');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Today is not Monday or Tuesday');
}
```

In this example, the value of `day` is `'Monday'`, so the output will be:

```
Today is Monday
```
