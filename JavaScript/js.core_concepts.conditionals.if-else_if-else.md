## The `if...else if...else` Statement

The `if...else if...else` statement executes different blocks of code for different conditions.

```javascript
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
```

Here is an example of an `if...else if...else` statement:

```javascript
let x = 10;

if (x > 20) {
    console.log('x is greater than 20');
} else if (x < 20) {
    console.log('x is less than 20');
} else {
    console.log('x is equal to 20');
}
```

In this example, the condition `x > 20` is false, and the condition `x < 20` is true, so the output will be:

```
x is less than 20
```
