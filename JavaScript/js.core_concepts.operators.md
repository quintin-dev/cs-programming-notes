# Operators in JavaScript

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript has the following types of operators:

-   Assignment operators

-   Comparison operators
-   Arithmetic operators
-   Bitwise operators
-   Logical operators
-   String operators
-   Conditional (ternary) operator
-   Comma operator
-   Unary operators
-   Relational operators
-   Grouping operators
-   Precedence operators
-   Destructuring operators
-   Spread operators

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. In JavaScript, we have the following assignment operators:

-   `=` : assigns a value to a variable

-   `+=` : adds a value to a variable
-   `-=` : subtracts a value from a variable
-   `*=` : multiplies a variable by a value
-   `/=` : divides a variable by a value
-   `%=` : assigns a remainder to a variable
-   `**=` : raises a variable to the power of a value
-   `<<=` : shifts a variable to the left
-   `>>=` : shifts a variable to the right
-   `>>>=` : shifts a variable to the right and fills with zeros
