## Overview

Web Audio API is a high-level JavaScript API for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The goal of this API is to include capabilities found in modern game audio engines and some of the mixing, processing, and filtering tasks that are found in modern desktop audio production applications. The Web Audio API is a powerful feature that can be used to synthesize and process audio.

## How to use Web Audio API

The Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an audio context, and has been designed to allow modular routing. Basic audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form an audio routing graph. Several sources — with different types of audio signals, user media, synthesized audio, etc. — are supported. These sources can be connected to several types of processing nodes that will process the audio data. After the audio has been processed, it is sent to the destination, usually the device that plays the audio.

## Use Cases

-   <b>Audio Visualization:</b> You can use the Web Audio API to create visualizations that react to the audio being played.
-   <b>Audio Effects:</b> You can use the Web Audio API to create audio effects like reverb, delay, and distortion.
