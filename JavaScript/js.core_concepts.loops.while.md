## while Loop

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is `true`. The syntax of the `while` loop is as follows:

```javascript
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here is an example of a `while` loop:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
```

In this example, the loop will run five times, and the output will be the same as the `for` loop example. The `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
