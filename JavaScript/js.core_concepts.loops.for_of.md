## for-of Loop

The `for-of` loop is used to iterate over the elements of an iterable object (like an array or a string). The syntax of the `for-of` loop is as follows:

```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here is an example of a `for-of` loop:

```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
```

In this example, the loop will iterate over the elements of the `colors` array and log each element to the console.
