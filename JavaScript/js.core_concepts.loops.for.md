## for Loop

The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times. The syntax of the `for` loop is as follows:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment / decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

The `initialization` statement is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. The `condition` is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is `true`, the code block is executed. The `increment / decrement` statement is executed after each iteration. The loop continues until the condition is `false`.

Here is an example of a `for` loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

In this example, the loop will run five times, and the output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```
