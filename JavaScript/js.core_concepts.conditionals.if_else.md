## The `if...else` Statement

The `if...else` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

![[js/syntax/conditionals#ifelse-statement-syntax]]

Here is an example of an `if...else` statement:

```javascript
let x = 10;

if (x > 20) {
    console.log('x is greater than 20');
} else {
    console.log('x is less than or equal to 20');
}
```

In this example, the condition `x > 20` is false, so the output will be:

```
x is less than or equal to 20
```

## The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an `if...else` statement.

```javascript
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

Here is an example of the ternary operator:

```javascript
let x = 10;

let result = x > 5 ? 'x is greater than 5' : 'x is less than or equal to 5';

console.log(result);
```

In this example, the condition `x > 5` is true, so the output will be:

```
x is greater than 5
```

The ternary operator can be used to assign values to variables based on conditions.
