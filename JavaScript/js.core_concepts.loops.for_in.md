## for-in Loop

The `for-in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. The syntax of the `for-in` loop is as follows:

```javascript
for (variable in object) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here is an example of a `for-in` loop:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}
```

In this example, the loop will iterate over the properties of the `person` object and log the key-value pairs to the console.
