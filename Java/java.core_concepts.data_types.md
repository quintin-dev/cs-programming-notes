# Data Types

Java has two categories of data types:

1. <b>Primitive Data Types:</b> These are the basic data types provided by Java. They are not objects and hold their values directly in memory.

2. <b>Reference Data Types</b> These are data types that refer to objects and are created using defined classes. They can hold references to objects and arrays.
